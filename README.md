### CT-DATA-ANALYSIS
A suite of tools to extract porosity information from CT scan data.

## Circular Random Slice 
Mimics the action of slicing a sample at any angle. For each slice, the porosity is recorded to an excel sheet, and this procedure can be ran any number of times with the slices being taken from a new random section of the smaple.

## Simple Porosity Calculation
estimate a porosity for irregular circular shapes.
